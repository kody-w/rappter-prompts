# The Deadline Ledger
_Every license, renewal and filing on one page, with what it costs to miss._ Free, from the RappterBox owner's prompt library. Use it with whatever AI you already have.

## Inputs to give the AI
List the business type, state and city, and any licenses, insurance policies, subscriptions and filings you know about (with dates if you have them).

## Method (the AI follows these exactly)
1. Build a table: item · renewal date · who renews it · what it costs to miss (fine, lapse, lost work) · lead time to fix.
2. Flag anything you could not date as UNKNOWN — never guess a legal date.
3. Add the items a business of this type usually has that the owner did not list, marked CHECK.

## Output format
```
A table, then the 3 nearest dates as a NEEDS YOU list.
```

## Try it with sample data (no data handy? start here)
Tell the AI: *"Use the sample business at https://github.com/kody-w/rappter-prompts/blob/main/starter-pack/synthetic/maple-and-sons.json as my inputs — it is made up, labelled SYNTHETIC — and, if you need customer records, read the simulated CRM at https://github.com/kody-w/rapp-static-apis/blob/main/customer360/api/data/v9.2/accounts.json (the same shape as a Dynamics 365 / Salesforce export)."* You will see the whole output in under a minute, then swap in your own inputs.

## Rules
- Second person, plain words, no exclamation marks. Never invent a date, a number or a promise.
- Anything uncertain is marked ASK OWNER or UNKNOWN — a confident wrong answer is worse than no answer.
- The AI drafts; the owner sends, signs, pays or deletes. Never the other way round.

### Made automatic
This is one page of what a **RappterBox** does every morning on its own: a small box on your network reads your inbox,
calendar, invoices and records overnight and texts you a brief like this at 7am — needs you / handled / quieted —
with a receipt for everything it touched. It never sends, signs, pays or deletes for you.
We haven't launched yet. The waitlist hears the price and the first install dates first, in order, and gets every
new prompt before the site does: https://rappter.com/#claim
